  People say JavaScript is a bad language. No built-in types, a fatiguing
  ecosystem, and demanding you to constantly explain, ‚Äúno, no, Java<b
    ><i>Script</i></b
  >‚Äù to anyone even vaguely non-technical.
</p>

<p>
  That‚Äôs why for my new Mario Kart knock-off game, I‚Äôve logically decided
  against using JavaScript at all. To be clear, this is
  <i>100% CSS.</i>
  My Photoshop licence ran out a while back, so this is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 images</li>
  <li>0 lines of JavaScript</li>
  <li>Just 100% CSS</li>
  <li>(okay fine, and 13 lines of HTML)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can control the racer using
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys#WASD_keys">
    WASD controls.
  </a>
  So how does it work? Let‚Äôs break it down.
</p>

<h2>Racers</h2>

<p>
  A cool thing that the CSS spec allows you to do with
  <code>box-shadow</code>
  and
  <code>linear-gradient</code>
  is to specify an arbitrary number of points. This is useful if you wanted two or
  three gradients, or to create some very basic CSS shapes.
</p>

<p>
  It‚Äôs also helpful if you wanted to manually specify every individual pixel of
  an image‚Ä¶ one-by-one‚Ä¶ in order‚Ä¶ directly into your stylesheet‚Ä¶ until
  eventually you have the original image stored in your source file!
</p>

<p>
  I actually got this idea from reading
  <a
    href="https://medium.com/@alcidesqueiroz/super-mario-world-in-css-100-css-no-javascript-no-embedded-images-data-uris-no-external-e43dc0c2b1f4"
  >
    Alcides Queiroz‚Äô great post
  </a>
  on creating a Pure CSS Super Mario animation.
</p>

<p>
  You might argue that this is absurd, has a much larger data cost than even the
  most naive image encoding, without
  <i>even going into</i>
  the implications of putting image-data into source files. And I might ignore your
  argument, and continue to speak, but slightly louder.
</p>

<p>Doing so allows us to create our racers, like below:</p>

<CodeSandbox
  id="7jk054508q"
  title="Mario Kart CSS (Just Mario)"
  initialFile="mario.css"
/>

<h2>Driving</h2>

<p>
  CSS is intentionally designed to be minimally interactive, so getting a kart
  that changes direction depending on keyboard input is a challenge.
</p>

<p>
  My initial thought was to have an
  <code>&lt;input type="text" /&gt;</code>, and have some selectors like
  <code>[type="text"][value="foo"]</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Tim Carry
  <a href="https://stories.algolia.com/a-search-engine-in-css-b5ec4e902e97">
    gave a great talk
  </a>
  on a Pure CSS search engine (with equally horrifying CSS). He used a very similar
  idea to drive his dynamic search results. The only drawback to the idea is that
  <b>
    <i>it doesn‚Äôt actually work.</i>
  </b>
  <code>value</code>
  isn‚Äôt set when you type ‚Äî it‚Äôs only the
  <i>initial</i>
  value that you can see in CSS. To get around this, Tim used
  <i>1 line</i>
  of JavaScript to set the
  <code>value</code>
  on input change.
</p>

<p>
  This is a fine workaround, and I certainly can‚Äôt fault Tim for it. In fact, I
  would have loved to have used the workaround. Unfortunately, I accidentally
  disabled JavaScript on my browser a few weeks ago, and still haven‚Äôt worked
  out how to turn it back on.
</p>

<p>
  So I needed something that CSS
  <i>did</i>
  respond to, with no JavaScript workarounds. After a few hours of searching around,
  I finally found a pseudoselector that looked to be of use ‚Äî
  <code>:valid</code>.
</p>

<p>
  An input <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-pattern"
    >with a pattern</a
  >
  specified has the corresponding <code>:valid</code> and <code>:invalid</code>
  pseudoselectors. This gives us 2 states to play with. Along with the
  <code>:placeholder-shown</code>
  selector, which tells us if the input is empty, we have 3 total states.
  <b>Empty</b>
  (middle), <b>valid</b> (left), and <b>invalid</b> (right).
</p>

<p>
  So with a giant invisible input, we get an interactive page that responds to
  left-right input.
</p>

<CodeSandbox id="8ylwqq8j39" title="CSS Input Example" initialFile="main.css" />

<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>
  Once <i>able</i> to respond to left/right input, we need to get the racers to
  <i>actually</i> turn left or right.
</p>

<p>
  We can do this by making 1 big racer image, made up of each frame of the
  ‚Äúturning‚Äù animation. This gives us our sprite, like the following image:
</p>

<img
  src="./blog/mario-kart-css/mario-sprite-example.png"
  alt="A sprite of Mario"
/>

<p>
  This allows us to then specify a manual keyframe animation, going through each
  ‚Äúframe‚Äù of the image.
</p>

<CodeSandbox
  id="62r107792k"
  title="Mario Turning Example"
  initialFile="main.css"
/>

<h2>Racer Select</h2>

<p>
  My brother always takes Mario when we play together, so I needed to be able to
  pick another racer. I picked Bowser because I respect how he‚Äôs not afraid to
  fail repeatedly at a task, despite not having a clear end-goal.
</p>

<p>
  To make the selection menu, we can make some <code>radio</code> inputs
  representing each racer. Our output should then show a different thing
  depending on which input is <code>:checked</code>, using the sibling
  combinators <code>+</code>, and <code>~</code>.
</p>

<CodeSandbox
  id="y0wk0920kx"
  title="Racer Selection Example"
  initialFile="main.css"
/>

<h2>Toggle Menus</h2>

<p>
  And lastly we need a way to be able to ‚Äútoggle‚Äù menus as either open or
  closed.
</p>

<p>
  I was originally planning on having the menus just be permanently open ‚Äî but
  this isn‚Äôt great for small screens, and my mum insisted on having the game on
  her phone so she could show her friends ‚Äúhow grown-up he‚Äôs getting‚Äù. So
  toggling menus it is.
</p>

<p>
  We can do this by listening to the <code>:focus</code> of whichever button you
  want to open the menu, and then allowing that button to lose focus when you want
  the menu to close.
</p>

<CodeSandbox
  id="ymxzyqlypz"
  title="Menu Toggle Example"
  initialFile="main.css"
/>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  In case it wasn‚Äôt painfully clear when I mentioned injecting pixel-by-pixel
  image data in your stylesheets, allow me to emphasise:
  <b>please don‚Äôt do any of these things.</b>
</p>

<p>
  This is mostly a thought experiment to see how far CSS can be pushed when you
  don‚Äôt have to worry about peer reviews, or your peers‚Äô respect.
