<p>
  Itâ€™s only so often you can wait 5 whole seconds for your build to apply your
  <code>color: blue;</code>
  to
  <code>color: red;</code>
  changeâ€¦
</p>

<p>
  At Onfido, we use webpack as our module bundler. As is always the case given
  the speed of development, our webpack config grew organically, and the speed
  of the pipeline was an after-thought.
</p>

<p>
  But there came a tipping point. Eventually, we snapped and decided to get that
  build time
  <i>way</i>
  down.
</p>

<p>
  There are already some great articles that discuss ways to increase build
  speed. To name just a few:

    </a>
    (on the webpack wiki)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We followed these articles very closely, and used a lot of their suggestions.
  But, we also made some changes that havenâ€™t been commonly mentioned anywhere
  else â€” so I want to discuss them here.
</p>

<h2>1. Measure</h2>

<p>
  We started by measuring our performance. This really helps to find your
  current bottlenecks, and compare your progress as you make changes.
</p>

<p>
  I created the
  <a href="https://github.com/stephencookdev/speed-measure-webpack-plugin/">
    Speed Measure Plugin
  </a>
  for webpack, which we used to analyse the performance of our plugins and
  loaders. This let us focus our search, and work out where the easiest wins
  were.
  <a href="/blog/announcing-smp">Iâ€™ve talked about SMP a bit already,</a>
  so wonâ€™t go into it in any more detail in this post.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, in a repo containing around 50,000 lines of JS/CSS code, these were
  our build times:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Locally (full build):
    <b>1 min, 48 secs</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Locally (watch mode changes
    <b>): 6.49 secs</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Jenkins (full production build):
    <b>3 mins, 26 secs</b>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  2. Upgrade and Parallelise
  <code>UglifyJsPlugin</code>
</h2>

<p>
  Even a cursory glance at SMPâ€™s output shows that
  <code>UglifyJsPlugin</code>
  takes a long time to run. For us it took
  <b>65%</b>
  of the
  <b>entire build</b>
  time!
</p>

<p>
  We were originally using webpack 3â€™s built-in
  <code>UglifyJsPlugin</code>
  which is set at version 0.4.6.
</p>

<p>
  However, thereâ€™s nothing stopping you from upgrading your
  <code>UglifyJsPlugin</code>
  version without upgrading webpack, and just manually importing the plugin
  instead.
</p>

<p>
  Version 1 of the plugin introduces some performance features â€” namely
  parallelisation, and caching. If youâ€™re only uglifying on a build server like
  Jenkins, then caching doesnâ€™t really help you.
</p>

<p>
  Turning on the
  <code>parallel</code>
  flag, however, can save you a lot of time â€” depending on how beefy your
  machine is, and how many cores it has. For us, running on i3.4xlarge EC2
  instances with 16 vCPUs, this was considerable.
</p>

<h2>3. Remove Image Loaders for Local Development</h2>

<p>
  Most webpack configs have a rule to handle images, and that rule is normally
  <code>file-loader</code>
  followed by
  <code>image-webpack-loader</code>
  , or some other similar image loader.
</p>

<p>
  But the only necessary loader here is the
  <code>file-loader</code>
  , which actually allows the image to end up in the output directory, and its
  URI passed to the bundle.
</p>

<p>
  The
  <code>image-webpack-loader</code>
  optimises these images, minifying and re-encoding them. For local development,
  this is quite a lot of unnecessary work.
</p>

<p>
  <i>
    Time saved:
    <b>20 seconds</b>
    locally
  </i>
</p>

<h2>4. Donâ€™t Cache for Production Builds</h2>

<p>
  There are a few ways to cache with webpack â€” like using
  <code>cache-loader</code>
  ,
  <code>HardSourceWebpackPlugin</code>
  , or the
  <code>?cacheLoader</code>
  babel flag. All of these caching methods have an overhead to boot up. The time
  saved locally during a re-run is huge, but the
  <b>initial</b>
  (cold) run will actually be slower.
</p>

<p>
  Caching on production builds that should be running from scratch each time
  anyway will just be slowing you down.
</p>

<p>

    <b>15 seconds</b>
    on Jenkins
  </i>
</p>

<h2>
  5. Remove
  <code>coffee-loader</code>
</h2>

<p>
  We had some legacy code that was written in CoffeeScript. This was never seen
  as that big a deal before, as the code was rarely touched, and the loader did
  its job fine.
</p>

<p>
  However, SMP revealed that
  <code>coffee-loader</code>
  was taking
  <b>1,078 ms</b>
  on average for each module. Compared with
  <code>babel-loader</code>
  taking an average of
  <b>561 ms,</b>
  this was an obvious enough opportunity for improvement. Not to mention the
  benefit of reducing the npm install time, and reducing our dependency count!
</p>

<p>
  Simply transpiling the CoffeeScript files to JS with the
  <code>coffee</code>
  CLI, and then manually cleaning them up removed this dependency for us.
</p>

<p>

    <b>10 seconds</b>

</p>

<h2>6. Remove ExtractTextPlugin for Local Development</h2>

<p>
  Using
  <code>ExtractTextPlugin</code>
  splits out part of your bundle into a separate files â€” most often by splitting
  out stylesheets into a separate CSS file.
</p>

<p>
  This can speed up the end-userâ€™s experience, but adds overhead into the
  compilation steps. So again, when running locally, this is unnecessary work.
  Fortunately, this plugin comes with a simple
  <code>disable</code>
  flag!
</p>

<p>
  (note that this is different to
  <code>DllPlugin</code>
  which splits out your bundle into a separate file, but does so in an entirely
  different process â€” which does massively help with your build speed).
</p>

<p>
  Time saved:
  <b>7 seconds</b>
  locally
</p>

<h2>
  7. Use Vanilla
  <code>css-loader</code>
  When Possible
</h2>

<p>
  Whether youâ€™re using PostCSS, SASS, or any other CSS tool, you likely donâ€™t
  need it running on
  <i>all</i>
  of your stylesheets. For us, we had some old legacy stylesheets, and
  stylesheets coming from third-party dependencies, which were all vanilla CSS.
</p>

<p>
  These donâ€™t need to run through PostCSS or SASS to compile into CSS â€” so
  separating out these into separate loader configs can give you a slight speed
  boost.
</p>

<p>
  Time saved:
  <b>2 seconds</b>
</p>

<hr />

<p>All things said and done, we reduced our build times to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Locally (full build, cold) â€” 1m48s â†’
    <b>58 secs</b>
    / (-46%)
  </li>
  <li>
    Locally (full build, warm) â€” 1m48s â†’
    <b>25 secs</b>
    / (-77%)
  </li>
  <li>
    Locally (watch mode changes) â€” 6.49s â†’
    <b>1.93 secs</b>
    / (-70%)
  </li>
  <li>
    Jenkins (full production build)â€” 3m26s â†’
    <b>1 min, 5 secs</b>
    / (-61%)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not too shabby!</p>

  But the webpack arts are dark ones, and Iâ€™m sure that weâ€™ve missed many good
  tricks. Keep vigilant, webpackers â€” and be sure to
